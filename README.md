This analysis will utilize data from the Citi Bike program in NYC, New York to see if it is worthwhile to invest in a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. The data from this study is extracted from public files released through Citi Bike NYC and is focused on data from 08/2019.


## Results
We select and highlight eight of the most popular starting locations in different locations around the Top Starting Locations map to focus and identify common characteristics.

Next, we look at the most popular length for trip durations. Based on the Trip Duration plot, the average bike trip duration is less than 30 minutes in length. Under ideal conditions, a healthy person can bike about 5 miles in 30 minutes indicating that the bike program is primarily being utilized for destinations that are less than five miles apart.

The most popular trip duration is only 5 minutes in length which also suggests that the typical customer is utilizing the bikes as a mode of transportation or recreation rather than for exercise.
## Summary
Overall this was a very interesting first use of Tableau to visualize data. The level of customization and additional features are apparent especially in relation to Excel used during beginning of course. Additionally, the learning curve is not quite as steep compared to the Python & Javascript visualizations performed in previous modules.

If I were to explore this particualr data set further, I would consider a deeper dive into:

Gender & User Type differences with the majority data sets removed (MALE & SUBSCRIBER) to see if there is any further detail which can be obtained from minority user groups.
Consider application of time as a layer to the geographical mapping to visualize peak and trough usage over the course of the day and to check if there is any geographic relationship.
